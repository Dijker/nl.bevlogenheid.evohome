### SDK 2 Notes ###

Working

- starting app, initializing driver with stored Thermostats
- storing and retrieving credentials in Homey
- OATH token and expiry ophalen (being stored in ManagerSettings)
- Retrieve QA status, trigger card
- Submit QA status (predefined) to Evohome system.
- 5 minute interval
- Pairing (based on new ID, so migration but most probably re-pairing is needed)
    - Pairing is currently based on 1 location only.
- Retrieve zone data ( temperature + set temperature)
- set individual temperature zones + reset ( possible bug in reset )
- Processing zone data for measure_temperature


In progress

- TODO process target_temperature data (same as measure_temperature, wellicht nieuwe trigger card toevoegen)
- Process retrieved zone data (dit moet in device.js, maar hoe voorkom je dat hij voor elk device opnieuw de URL aanroept, want dan ga je tegen accountlimits aanlopen)
  - mogelijke oplossing; in app.js de boel uitlezen, die in settings opslaan per ID, en dat dan elke 5 minuten weer uitlezen in device.js ; zie ook https://github.com/athombv/nl.thermosmart/blob/abe2f2f8a94c22350bf32d2e23d3b30bc494e050/drivers/thermostat/device.js
- retrieving old account Settings (settings/index.html) ( for migration from v1 app )

Next up
3 - DONE Zones uitlezen
5 - IN PROGRESS Pairing van thermostaten --> push naar BETA want identieke functionaliteit
6 - Pairing met meerdere locaties ( data model prepared for this, I think )

Future features

- Low battery detection
- Check when heating mode is changing ( e.g. following  schedule , permament, etc)
- Time limits on quick Actions
- Time limits on temperature heatSetpoint
- DHW (hot water device)


KNOWN BUGS

- Reset temperature does set the 'follow schedule', but target_temperature stays 'old number' until a change in schedule is accomplished <- needs validation if this impacts or use URL from old/lib/evohomey
- If token expired, sometimes a read of zones and quickactions will not result in an update and even an error in the console. Doesn't crash app, all next actions (e.g.next update (after 5 minutes)) is OK.
- Driver code needs its own login function . 1-on-1 Copied from evohomey.js function

== OLD code in 'old/' directory ==

### END SDK 2 Notes ###

### Honeywell Evohome

With this app you can manage your Evohome and other systems that connect via Total Connect Comfort from within Homey. It is using the unofficial API of Evohome.

### Supported devices

The following devices are known to work with the app:

Control systems:

- Evohome ( + gateway RFG100 )
- Evohome Wifi
- Round Wireless ( + gateway RFG100 )

Thermostats (always in combination with Control system)

- HR92

Not in the list? It still could be supported; as long as your thermostat can be controlled via the Total Connect Comfort app, it should be controllable by the Homey app. Feedback is appreciated, so I can adjust the list.

### Settings
After installing the application, first visit the Homey Settings and navigate to the 'Honeywell Evohome' application.

Fill in your username (email address) and password and press save. Then, go to Devices and add a Honeywell Evohome device. Press thermostat and select which devices you'd like to add into Homey.

### Flow support

*Triggers*

- When temperature changes: triggers a flow when temperature changes
    - Via device card: individual temperature changes
    - Via Evohome card: any temperature measurement changes
- When target temperature changes: triggers a flow when the target temperature setting changes
    - Via device card: individual target temperature settings changes

*Conditions*

No conditions defined at this moment

*Actions*

- Set temperature ; this will set the individual temperature on a device. Attention: there is no way yet to cancel this setting other than setting another temperature or using the Evohome app/system.

- Reset temperature: Cancel individual device setting

- Execute QuickAction ; these are the generic settings of your Evohome. You can choose between:
    - Auto: this is the normal mode, Evohome will follow the set program
    - Economy: this is the economy mode, normally 3 degrees lower than Auto
    - Heating Off: This will turn your heating off ( with a lower limit of 7 degrees to protect the system from freezing )
    - Away: This will set the Evohome system to Away mode
    - Day Off: This will set the Evohome system to 'Day off' mode
    - Custom: This will set the Evohome system to 'Custom' mode; whatever you configured in Evohome itself

- Execute QuickAction (manual entry); with this card you can enter the quickaction yourself. This is usefull if you have stored a quickaction value in a variable in Homey, this can be used e.g. to restore a previous setting. e.g. door open, set quickaction for heating off, then when door closes, set quickaction with variable where the previous status was stored (e.g. Auto).

All actions are currently on 'permanent' mode. In the future there might be timers (e.g. set Economy for two hours). If you need that now, using the Homey built in-timers or the CountDown app to trigger a timed event.

### Speech

No speech support at this moment

### Limitations

Only 1 Evohome system is supported.

### ToDo

- Add hot water device support
- Add multiple location support
- Add target temperature triggers
- Add speech support
- Clean-up code
- Add timeout to code if Evohome service doesn't respond
- Add error checking in code
- Translation to NL

### Known bugs

In order of priority:

[ Solved 1.0.2 ] : Manual entry of set temperature didn't take any 'tokens' as input
[ Solved 1.0.0 ] : QuickActions are back
[ Solved 0.4.9 ] : Logging and showing in cards of target temperature when set in a flow is now working
[ Solved 0.4.7 ] : Cancel temperature didn't work in some circumstances. Should be OK now.

### Unknown bugs

Yes ;-)
